# Grunt start project

Every time I start a new project I end up copy and pasting / deleting this code...


You use grunt and bower to start your projects?
Want to optimize your css and js? Minification? Concatenation?

This is the start project you will need. Just start with:
`npm install` and then `grunt`.

If you want to install a new package with bower just use, for example:
`bower install jquery`

If you don't want to use sass just remove those folders.
